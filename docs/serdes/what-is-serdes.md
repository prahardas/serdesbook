---

**SerDes** (Serializer/Deserializer) is a pair of functional blocks commonly used to convert data between serial and parallel interfaces in high-speed communication systems.

### Key Concepts:
- Serializer: Converts parallel data to serial
- Deserializer: Converts serial back to parallel
- Reduces pin count, simplifies routing
- Common in PCIe, SATA, JESD204, Ethernet

### Applications:
- Inter-IC communication
- Backplanes
- Optical and copper interfaces
