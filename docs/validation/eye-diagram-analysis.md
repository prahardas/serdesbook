title: Eye Diagram Analysis
---

**Eye diagrams** are critical visual tools used to assess the quality of high-speed signals.

### What it shows:
- Timing jitter
- Signal amplitude
- ISI patterns

### Key Metrics:
- Eye height (vertical opening)
- Eye width (horizontal opening)
- BER bathtub curve (if measured statistically)

Use instruments like oscilloscopes or IBIS-AMI simulations to generate these diagrams.
