title: MATLAB vs Python for SerDes Simulation
---

Both MATLAB and Python are widely used for SerDes modeling and validation.

| Feature        | MATLAB                    | Python (e.g. SignalIntegrity) |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Licensing      | Paid                      | Open-source                   |
| Toolboxes      | SI, DSP, SerDes           | Scipy, SignalIntegrity        |
| Visualization  | Built-in                  | Matplotlib, Plotly            |
| Ecosystem      | Industry-standard in labs | Rapidly growing in academia   |
