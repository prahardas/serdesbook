title: FFE Basics (Feed-Forward Equalization)
---

**Feed-Forward Equalization (FFE)** is a linear equalization technique applied on the transmitter side to shape the output signal to counteract channel impairments.

### Why FFE?
- Compensates for ISI (Inter-Symbol Interference)
- Improves eye opening at receiver

### FFE Tap Example:
- Pre-tap: Reduces preceding pulse interference
- Main-tap: Core signal strength
- Post-tap: Cancels succeeding symbol distortion
