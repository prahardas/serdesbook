## 📚 Purpose

This project aims to become the definitive handbook and wiki for:

- High-speed SerDes design principles
- Equalization techniques (FFE, DFE, CTLE)
- Simulation and modeling (IBIS-AMI, MATLAB, Python)
- Validation workflows (Eye diagrams, BER, jitter)
- Tool comparisons and best practices
